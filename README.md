# Word-Guess-Game
##### Homework Assignment 3: Challenge - JavaScript

This is the Challenging Version of Homework #3 (the Basic Version can be found on my [Portfolio](https://sasquatchxyz.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/)).  This game is a game of Hangman played where all the word options are animals... specifically all of the national animals... and then some.  You are given ten guesses to complete the word, and the win's total and guessed letters are displayed.
